# Exercise 1.10

Find a web server that produces a large amount of data. Investigate caching by
running `fetchall` twice in succession to see whether the reported time
changes much. Do you get the same content each time? Modify `fetchall` to
print its output to a file so it can be examined.

# Exercise 1.11

Try `fetchall` with longer argument lists, such as samples from the top million
web sites available at `alexa.com`. How does the program behave if a web site
just doesn't respond?
